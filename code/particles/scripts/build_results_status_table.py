"""Build the `/particles`-native public prediction surface.

Chain role: assemble the live per-sector outputs from the active local
derivation chain into one public candidate-or-gap table.

Mathematics: this file does not derive masses itself; it applies promotion
policy, ledger mapping, residual reporting, and surface provenance rules.

OPH-derived inputs: the local `/particles` calibration, flavor, neutrino, and
hadron artifacts only. No legacy ancillary predictor surface is imported here.

Output: `RESULTS_STATUS.md`, `results_status.json`, and the machine-readable
public surface snapshot used for audits and progress tracking.

    "The live forward transmutation certificate makes that order explicit on disk: the same source-only basis reconstructs `alpha_U`, the unified diffusion parameter `t_U = 4*pi^2*alpha_U`, and the transmutation exponent `t_tr = 2*pi / ((N_c + 1) * alpha_U)` without reading them back from measured couplings. "
    "The selected current-carrier chart is closed and remains explicit on disk, but the active public electroweak surface is now the target-free source-only theorem `EWTargetFreeRepairValueLaw_D10`. "
    "That theorem emits the repaired chart `(tau2_tree_exact, delta_n_tree_exact)` from the D10 source basis alone using `lambda_EW = eta_source^2 / (4 * beta_EW)`, then emits one coherent electroweak quintet from one repaired coupling pair. "
    "On the paper-facing theorem lane the transmutation factor is `beta_transmutation_EW = N_c + 1`; older overloaded beta ratios survive only on compare-only validation readouts. "
    "So the public D10 W/Z values are no longer freeze-once rows. The older freeze-once coherent repair law is retained only as compare-only validation and agrees with the target-free theorem to machine scale: about `+1.54e-08` GeV on `W` and `-1.40e-08` GeV on `Z`. "

    "This closes the electroweak mass-side lane on the Phase II calibration tier; the earlier source-only underdetermination theorem, minimal conditional route through `ColorBalancedQuadraticRepairDescent_D10`, and former candidate `EWTargetEmitter_D10` remain on disk only as historical scaffolding beneath the promoted theorem."

    "`mu_e_absolute_log_candidate` or `g_e_linear_candidate` and convert exactly once via `g_e = exp(mu_e_absolute_log_candidate)`. "
    "But the present charged theorem still fixes only the centered charged log class modulo a common shift, so the absolute scale `g_e` remains unresolved on the live theorem lane. "
    "At theorem level, the exact waiting set is sharper than a standalone eta/sigma fit: the charged sector-response object is still only the latent candidate `C_hat_e^{cand}`, not a declared theorem-grade operator. Promoting that candidate is blocked by the upstream theorem `oph_generation_bundle_branch_generator_splitting`, reduced further to the clause `compression_descendant_commutator_vanishes_or_is_uniformly_quadratic_small_after_central_split`. The local corpus proves neither exact vanishing nor uniform quadratic smallness of that descended commutator yet. The exact minimal operator-side extension is already packaged on disk as `central_split_quadratic_commutator_transfer`, but `current_corpus_contains_theorem = false`: it has not been internalized into the live theorem corpus. On the absolute side, the charged equalizer route is an explicit no-go under common-shift symmetry: the current theorem emits only the quotient class of charged logs modulo `(1,1,1)`, so no theorem-grade `g_e` or `Delta_e_abs` exists yet. The layered frontier is explicit on disk as `oph_charged_absolute_frontier_factorization`: on the current surface the missing affine object is `A_ch`, while conditional on future theorem-grade `C_hat_e` promotion the post-promotion burden sharpens to the refinement-stable uncentered trace lift `refinement_stable_uncentered_trace_lift`. Inside that lift, the descended scalar is `mu_phys(Y_e)`, carried by `oph_charged_mu_physical_descent_reduction`, and the exact smaller forcing object beneath that scalar is `oph_charged_physical_identity_mode_equalizer`, the fiberwise zero-cocycle certificate on theorem-grade physical `Y_e`. "
    "The sharpest constructive route is therefore two-layered and still only an extension candidate, not a current-corpus closure. First, if the actual centered compressed generator factors through centered Schur-type `P->Q->P` feedback with a refinement-uniform middle-factor bound, then internalizing that packaged extension would close the transfer gap exactly when the descended commutator vanishes and otherwise only quadratically. On the current local certificate, the proxy margin would survive such an internalization whenever the uniform bound satisfies about `M < 119.5600535277701`. That route can promote only the centered proxy `C_hat_e^{cand}`. Beyond that promotion step, the post-promotion single slot is the refinement-stable uncentered trace lift carried by `oph_charged_post_promotion_absolute_closure_route`: once that lift is refinement-stable on theorem-grade physical `Y_e`, the physical identity-mode equalizer `delta(r,r') = 0` on same-`Y_e` refinement pairs forces one descended scalar `charged_physical_affine_scalar_mu`, from which the uncentered lift, determinant-line section, and affine charged anchor follow canonically, with `C_tilde_e(Y_e) = C_hat_e(Y_e) + mu_phys(Y_e) I`, `A_ch(Y_e) = (1/3) log det(Y_e)`, or equivalently `A_ch(Y_e) = (1/3) tr(log Y_e)`. "
    "A D12 continuation bridge exists under the extra assumptions A1-A3 and gives eta = -6.729586682888832 and sigma = 8.154061112725994 with near-exact centered-log shape closure, "
    "but the theorem-grade lane still lacks emitted eta, sigma, and absolute scale. On that continuation bridge the compare-only absolute target would be `g_e* = 0.04577885783568762`, equivalently `Delta_e_abs* = 3.003986333402356`, and that target is kept strictly non-promotable until a theorem-grade absolute anchor `A_ch` exists on the live branch."

Same-sheet rephasing preserves entrywise CKM moduli and the corpus emits no sector-attached same-label left-handed lift from `sigma_ref` to a physical `Sigma_ud` carrier. "
    "The mass-side theorem boundary is exact. On the minimal light branch `y_u = c_u * epsilon^6`, `y_d = c_d * epsilon^6`, `epsilon = 1/6`, so `Delta_ud_overlap = (1/6) * log(c_d / c_u)`.

"
    "The physical-sheet theorem boundary is also exact: the missing object is a sector-attached section from the common-refinement frame-overlap quotient to the physical same-label left-handed carrier `Sigma_ud^phys = {(sigma_id, tau, U_uL, U_dL, V_CKM, I_CKM) : V_CKM = U_uL^dagger U_dL} / ~`, with diagonal rephasing equivalence `(U_uL, U_dL, V) ~ (U_uL D_u, U_dL D_d, D_u^dagger V D_d)`.

The missing theorem is the target-free promotion of that mean split to the physical sheet, after which the ordered three-point quadratic readout emits the sextet. "
    "The present premise set carries a strict no-go for full physical quark closure: it does not emit `quark_d12_t1_value_law`, it does not emit a sector-attached same-label left-handed lift from `sigma_ref` to the physical CKM shell, and it does not emit a target-free physical-sheet readout `(g_u, g_d)`.

    "The exact next objects to compute are therefore the minimal extension triple `H_mass : ell_ud = log(c_d / c_u)`, `H_phys : s_ud^phys : M_ud^{CR,phys} -> Sigma_ud^phys`, and `H_abs : A_q^phys : Sigma_ud^phys -> R`. "
