# Calibration Lane

This lane exists to answer one exactness question cleanly:

If the current D10 branch misses electroweak calibration observables, is that
because `P` needs more digits, or because the D10 transport / matching package
is not yet the exact closure branch?

The immediate tool is an implied-`P` audit. For each D10 observable, solve for
the pixel constant that would make the current implementation hit the declared
target exactly. If different observables imply different `P` values, then the
present bottleneck is not just decimal precision in `P`.

The second tool is a scheme-freezing artifact for the current D10 branch. That
artifact records the exact single-`P` running electroweak family already
realized by the code and separates it from the mixed run/pole reporting
surface. If pole/effective reporting is required, the remaining exact missing
object is then one common `EWTransportKernel_D10`, not more digits of `P`.

## Active Calibration Files

The active calibration scripts now open with the same short derivation header:

- `Chain role`: where the file sits between the D10 core, the reduced
  two-scalar carrier, the selector, and the public readout
- `Mathematics`: which fixed-point, transport, or Jacobian step is being used
- `OPH-derived inputs`: which calibration quantities come directly from the D10
  core already emitted in `/particles`
- `Output`: which downstream calibration artifact the file is responsible for

For the live branch, the main path is:

- `derive_d10_ew_observable_family.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_source_transport_pair.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_population_evaluator.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_exact_closure_beyond_current_carrier.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_fiberwise_population_tree_law_beneath_single_tree_identity.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_tau2_current_carrier_obstruction.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_exact_wz_coordinate_beyond_single_tree_identity.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_exact_mass_pair_chart_current_carrier.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_repair_branch_beyond_current_carrier.py`
- `derive_d10_ew_source_transport_readout.py`
- `derive_d11_forward_seed.py`
- `derive_d11_forward_seed_promotion_certificate.py`

The live D10 split is now explicit:

- builder-local current-carrier frontier:
  `EWExactMassPairSelector_D10`
- broader honest exact-PDG frontier:
  `D10RepairBranchBeyondCurrentCarrier`
- strongest strictly smaller constructive primitive beneath that broader frontier:
  `EWSinglePostTransportTreeIdentity_D10`

So the current carrier is no longer treated as the whole D10 story. It closes
its own exact chart, while the active public electroweak surface is now the
closed target-free source-only repair theorem above that carrier. The older
repair-branch artifacts remain on disk as historical scaffolding and validation
layers, not as the active public theorem surface.

## Commands

Run the current implied-`P` audit:

```bash
python3 particles/calibration/implied_p_consistency_audit.py
```

This writes:

- [`particles/runs/calibration/implied_p_consistency.json`](/Users/muellerberndt/Projects/oph-meta/particles/runs/calibration/implied_p_consistency.json)

Run the local calibration guard:

```bash
python3 particles/calibration/test_single_p_consistency.py
python3 particles/calibration/derive_d10_ew_observable_family.py
python3 particles/calibration/test_d10_observable_family_artifact.py
python3 particles/calibration/derive_d10_ew_transport_kernel.py
python3 particles/calibration/test_d10_ew_transport_kernel_artifact.py
```

That guard checks the solver mechanics and the presence of the current D10
calibration observables. It is not a claim that exact single-`P` closure has
already been achieved.
